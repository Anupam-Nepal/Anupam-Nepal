Hello! My name is Anupam Nepal. I am from Tribhuvan University, Nepal currently taking the course of Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Information Technology.
I have a huge interest in coding. Currently I am studying Python and its libraries.
I love to join different communities involved in this sector.
